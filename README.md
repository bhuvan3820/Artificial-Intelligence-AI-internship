# Artificial-Intelligence-AI-internship
This project automates the book publishing process by scraping chapter content, taking screenshots, converting them to PDF, rewriting and reviewing the text using simulated AI, and storing the final version in ChromaDB for intelligent retrieval using RL search. It showcases a full AI-assisted publication pipeline.
